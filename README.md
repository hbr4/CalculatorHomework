## Calculator Homework
In this assignment, we created a simple calculator that did addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, and square root. Initially, a dockerfile was created which laid the groundwork for utilizing the calculator.

Next a python script called CalculatorTestsAll was created which defined the mathematical operators for the six operations stated above. Each operation was linked to its own Python Unit test which allowed the ability to use the CSV files to complete the operations.

The docker program was run which exported the CSV test runs. All files were uploaded to Github.
